WordPress Plugin: TinyMCE Custom Email Button. Adds a button to the visual editor which converts the selected text into a custom mailto link.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a buttons to TinyMCE editor which converts the selected text into a custom mailto link. 

I created this plugin when my Marketing team struggled to type 'mailto:â€™ each time they needed to include an email link, since the default link button would not add it by itself. There were similar plugins, but they were lacking in functionality. For example, if a tag had any styling, it would lose it. Or it would require a full email typed up in order to convert it into an email link. With this plugin, you can simply select a text, press Email button and it would pop a prompt window where you would type any valid email address.

**Language Support:** English.
